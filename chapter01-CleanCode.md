# Chapter 01. Clean Code
## There Will Be Code
**Models and Requirements**:
- It is said that code will be no more meaningless than before.
- But **CODE = DETAILS OF THE REQUIREMENTS**
- => specifying requirements = programming, specification = code with **rigor, accuracy, formality**

## Bad Code
Bad(Messy) Code is created by:
1. At the moment in a rush
2. It is better than nothing

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
mess ↑ → productivity ↓(asymptotically approaching 0) → time ↑
### The Grand Redesign in the Sky
If there is a high demand for redesign the system, the team is split into two, one for maintaining the current system, and the other for redesigning the system. It might be taken long to replace the old system to new one. When the new system is done, there would be a demand of redesign of the new system.
### Attitude
The reason why good code quickly rot into bad code is because we are unprofessional.
Programmers should tell managers what we think and defend the code from schedule and requirements from managers with equal passion.
### The Primal Conundrum
All developers are forced to make mess to meet deadlines. However, every mess cause slow down.
=> The only way to make the deadline-the only way to go fast-is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
### The Art of Clean Code?
Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of "cleanliness".
=> **Code-Sense**: options offered for programmer to choose the best variation and guide to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations.
### What Is Clean Code?
 - elegant, efficient and focused
 - simple and direct -> readability
 - easy for others to enhance it, test acceptancy, minimal dependencies, literacy
 - written by someone who cares
 - no duplication, high expressiveness, simple abstractions
## We Are Authors
Making the code to be easy read leads to easier code writing.
## The Boy Scout Rule

> Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.

Cleaning up the code does not mean that needs to be changed a lot.
